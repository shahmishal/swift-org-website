  <p>Everyone is welcome to contribute to Swift.
Contributing doesn’t just mean submitting pull requests—there
are many different ways for you to get involved,
including answering questions on the forums,
reporting or triaging bugs, and participating in the Swift evolution process.</p>

<p>No matter how you want to get involved,
we ask that you first learn what’s expected
of anyone who participates in the project
by reading the <a href="/community">Community Overview</a>.
If you’re contributing code, you should also know how to build and run
Swift from the repository,
as described in <a href="/documentation/source-code">Source Code</a>.</p>

<p>Reporting bugs is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. The open source Swift project uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs.</p>

<div class="info">
  <p>If a bug can be reproduced only within an Xcode project or a playground,
or if the bug is associated with an Apple NDA,
please file a report to Apple’s <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com">bug reporter</a> instead.</p>
</div>

<p>When opening an issue, please include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A concise description of the problem.</strong>
If the issue is a crash, include a stack trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A reproducible test case.</strong>
Double-check that your test case reproduces the issue. A relatively small sample (roughly within 50 lines of code) is best pasted directly into the description; a larger one may be uploaded as an attachment. Consider reducing the sample to the smallest amount of code possible—a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more appealing to сontributors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A description of the environment that reproduces the problem.</strong>
Include information about the Swift compiler’s version, the deployment target (if explicitly set) and your platform.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Because Swift is under very active development, we receive a lot of bug reports. Before opening a new issue, take a moment to browse our <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues">existing issues</a> to reduce the chance of reporting a duplicate.</p>

<div class="warning">
  <p>Before filing an issue requesting a new language feature, see the <a href="#participating-in-the-swift-evolution-process">Swift Evolution Process section</a>.</p>

<p>Reporting bugs is an important part of improving software.
Nearly as important is triaging those bugs
to ensure that they are reproducible, small, and unique.</p>

<p>There are a number of things you can do to help triage bugs
in the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reproduce bugs</strong>.
For a bug to be actionable,
it needs to be reproducible.
If you can’t reproduce the bug,
try to figure out why.
Get in touch with the submitter if you need more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduce bugs</strong>.
Once a bug can be reproduced,
reduce it to the smallest amount of code possible.
Reasoning about a sample that reproduces a bug in just a few lines of Swift code
is easier than reasoning about a longer sample.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eliminate duplicate bugs</strong>.
If two bug reports refer to the same underlying problem,
mark the newer one as a duplicate of the older one.
Doing so allows others to work more effectively.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Good first issues are bugs, ideas, and tasks that are intended to be accessible
for contributors that are new to working on the Swift project, and even new to
the patterns and concepts behind subprojects such as the Swift compiler.
Good first issues are decorated with a corresponding label and are most easily
found by visiting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">github.com/apple/&lt;repository&gt;/contribute</code>, e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/contribute">github.com/apple/swiftlang/contribute</a>
for the main Swift repository.
They are expected to be low-priority and of modest scope, and not require
excessive refactoring, research, or debugging — rather, they should encourage
newcomers to dip their toes in some part of Swift, learn more about it, and
make a real contribution.</p>

<p>Anyone with <a href="#commit-access">commit access</a> and insight into a particular area
is welcome and encouraged to pin down or think up good first issues.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that you become familiar with using Swift in your own projects before contributing directly to the language itself. We put together handy <a href="/getting-started/" title="How to setup your own version of Swift">Getting Started</a> guides with step-by-step instructions to get you up and running.</p>

<p>The Swift project uses <em>small, incremental changes</em> as its preferred development model.  Sometimes these changes are small bug fixes. Other times, these changes are small steps along the path to reaching larger stated goals.  In contrast, long-term development branches can leave the community without a voice during development. Some additional problems with long-term branches include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resolving merge conflicts can take a lot of time if branch development and mainline development occur in the same pieces of code.</li>
  <li>People in the community tend to ignore work on branches.</li>
  <li>Very large changes are difficult to code review.</li>
  <li>Branches are not routinely tested by the continuous integration infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these problems, Swift uses an incremental development style.  Small changes are preferred whenever possible.  We require contributors to follow this practice when making large or otherwise invasive changes. Some tips follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Large or invasive changes usually have secondary changes that must be made before the large change (for example, API cleanup or addition). Commit these changes before the major change, independently of that work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If possible, decompose the remaining interrelated work into unrelated sets of changes. Next, define the first increment and get consensus on the development goal of the change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make each change in the set either stand alone (for example, to fix a bug) or part of a planned series of changes that work toward the development goal. Explaining these relationships to the community can be helpful.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in making a large change and feel unsure about its overall effect, please make sure to first discuss the change and reach a consensus through the <a href="/community/#swift-development">developer forums</a>. Then ask about the best way to go about making the change.</p>

<p>Although we don’t enforce a strict format for commit messages, we prefer that you follow the guidelines below, which are common among open source projects.  Following these guidelines helps with the review process, searching commit logs, and email formatting. At a high level, the contents of the commit message should be to convey the rationale of the change, without delving into much detail. For example, “bits were not set right” leaves the reviewer wondering about which bits and why they weren’t “right”. In contrast, “Correctly compute ‘is dependent type’ bits in ‘Type’” conveys almost all there is to the change.</p>

<p>Below are some guidelines about the format of the commit message itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Separate the commit message into a single-line <em>title</em> and a separate <em>body</em> that describes the change.</li>
  <li>Make the title concise to be easily read within a commit log and to fit in the subject line of a commit email.</li>
  <li>In changes that are restricted to a specific part of the code, include a [tag] at the start of the line in square brackets—for example, “[stdlib] …” or “[SILGen] …”. This tag helps email filters and searches for post-commit reviews.</li>
  <li>When there is a body, separate it from the title by an empty line.</li>
  <li>Make body concise, while including the complete reasoning. Unless required to understand the change, additional code examples or other details should be left to bug comments or the mailing list.</li>
  <li>If the commit fixes an issue in the bug tracking system, include a link to the issue in the message.</li>
  <li>For text formatting and spelling, follow the same rules as documentation and in-code comments—for example, the use of capitalization and periods.</li>
  <li>If the commit is a bug fix on top of another recently committed change, or a revert or reapply of a patch, include the Git revision number of the prior related commit, e.g. “Revert abcdef because it caused bug#”.</li>
</ul>

<p>For minor violations of these guidelines, the community normally favors reminding the contributor of this policy over reverting. Minor corrections and omissions can be handled by sending a reply to the commits mailing list.</p>

<p>When contributors submit a change to a Swift subproject, after that change is approved, other developers with commit access may commit it for the author. When doing so, it is important to retain correct attribution of the contribution. Generally speaking, Git handles attribution automatically.</p>

<p>We do not want the source code to be littered with random attributions like “this code written by J. Random Hacker”, which is noisy and distracting. Do not add contributor names to the source code or documentation.</p>

<p>In addition, don’t commit changes authored by others unless they have submitted the change to the project or you have been authorized to submit on their behalf—for example, you work together and your company authorized you to contribute the changes. The author should first either submit the change through a pull request to the relevant project, email the development list, or add a bug tracker item. If someone sends you a change privately, encourage them to submit it to the appropriate list first.</p>

<p>The Swift project relies heavily on code review to improve software quality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All significant changes, by all developers, must be reviewed before they are committed to the repository.  Smaller changes (or changes where the developer owns the component) can be reviewed after being committed.</li>
  <li>Code reviews are conducted on GitHub (through comments on pull requests or commits) and are reflected on the relevant project’s commit mailing list.</li>
  <li>The developer responsible for a code change is also responsible for making all necessary review-related changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the change is ready to be committed. After a change is sent out for review it needs an explicit approval before it’s submitted. Do not assume silent approval or request active objections to the patch by setting a deadline.</p>

<p>Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you would hope for, especially for larger features. Here are some accepted ways to speed up review times for your patches:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Review other people’s changes.</strong> If you help out, everybody will be more willing to do the same for you.  Goodwill is our currency.</li>
  <li><strong>Split your change into multiple smaller changes.</strong> The smaller your change, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick look at it.</li>
  <li><strong>Ping the change.</strong> If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to get this change landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week. Remember that you’re asking for valuable time from other professional developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that anyone is welcome to review and give feedback on a change, but only people with commit access to the repository can approve it.</p>

<p>Developers are required to create test cases for any bugs fixed and any new features added, and to contribute them along with the changes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All feature and regression test cases are added to the appropriate test directory—for example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift/test</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Write test cases at the abstraction level nearest to the actual feature. For example, if it’s a Swift language feature, write it in Swift; if it’s a SIL optimization, write it in SIL.</li>
  <li>Reduce test cases as much as possible, especially for regressions. It’s unacceptable to place an entire failing program into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift/test</code> because this slows down testing for all developers. Please keep them short.</li>
</ul>

<p>People depend on Swift to create their production software.  This means that a bug in Swift could cause bugs in thousands, even millions of developers’ products.  Because of this, the Swift project maintains a high bar for quality.  The minimum quality standards that any change must satisfy before being committed to the main development branch include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Code must compile without errors or warnings on at least one platform.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes and new features must include a test case to pinpoint any future regressions, or include a justification for why a test case would be impractical.</li>
  <li>Code must pass the appropriate test suites—for example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift/test</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swift/validation-test</code> test suites in the Swift compiler.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing any problems found in the future that the change may cause. This responsibility means that you may need to update your change in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the code compiles cleanly on all primary platforms.</li>
  <li>Fix any correctness regressions found in other test suites.</li>
  <li>Fix any major performance regressions.</li>
  <li>Fix any performance or correctness regressions in the downstream Swift tools.</li>
  <li>Fix any performance or correctness regressions that result in customer code that uses Swift.</li>
  <li>Address any bugs that appear in the bug tracker as a result from your change.</li>
</ul>

<p>We prefer that these issues be handled before submission, but we understand that it isn’t possible to test all of this for every submission. Our continuous integration (CI) infrastructure normally finds these problems. We recommend watching the CI infrastructure throughout the next day to look for regressions. The CI infrastructure will directly email you if a group of commits that included yours caused a failure. You are expected to check those messages to see whether they are your fault and, if so, fix the breakage.</p>

<p>Commits that clearly violate these quality standards may be reverted, in particular when the change blocks other developers from making progress. The developer is welcome to recommit the change after the problem has been fixed.</p>

<p>This contributor ladder defines the roles you might gain while contributing to Swift on GitHub. Each role has privileges associated, which requires building trust with the community of contributors. We recognize there are many different types of contributors to Swift and we appreciate every single one! Everyone who has participated in the open source Swift project is a <em>Contributor</em>: This can be by writing code, answering questions on the forums, reporting or triaging bugs, or participating in the Swift evolution process.</p>

<p>As you climb the contributor ladder by contributing to Swift on GitHub, you gain new privileges but also gain trust and responsibilities that you are expected to fulfill. If a contributor violates this trust and these responsibilities, the Core Team may give them a notice and upon repeated infringements revoke their level. We believe in a healthy community and hope this action will never be necessary.</p>

<p>Commit access is granted to contributors with a track record of submitting high-quality changes. If you would like commit access, please send an email to <a href="mailto:code-owners@forums.swift.org">the code owners list</a> with the GitHub user name that you want to use and a list of 5 non-trivial pull requests that were accepted without modifications.</p>

<p>Once you’ve been granted commit access, you will be able to commit to all of the GitHub repositories that host Swift.org projects.  To verify that your commit access works, please make a test commit (for example, change a comment or add a blank line).  The following policies apply to users with commit access:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You are granted commit-after-approval to all parts of Swift. To get approval, create a pull request. When the pull request is approved, you may merge it yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may commit an obvious change without first getting approval. The community expects you to use good judgment. Examples are reverting obviously broken patches, correcting code comments, and other minor changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are allowed to commit changes without approval to the portions of Swift to which you have contributed or for which you have been assigned responsibility. Such commits must not break the build. This is a “trust but verify” policy, and commits of this nature are reviewed after being committed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Code owners are individuals assigned to specific areas of the Swift project, with code quality their primary responsibility. The umbrella Swift project is composed of numerous sub-projects including the Swift standard library, extensions to the LLDB debugger, and the Swift package manager, to name a few. Each sub-project will be assigned a code owner.  The code owner then works to get all contributions reviewed, gather feedback from the community, and shepherd approved patches into the product.</p>

<p>Anyone can review a piece of code, and we welcome code review from everyone that is interested. Code review procedures are not dictated by a central, global policy. Instead, the process is defined by each code owner.</p>

<p>Any community member that is active and shows themselves to be valuable can offer to become a code owner via posting to the forums, or be nominated by another member.  If fellow contributors agree, the project lead will make the appointment and add the new owner’s name to the code owners file. The position is completely voluntary, and can be resigned at any time.</p>

<p>The list of current code owners can be found in the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CODE_OWNERS.txt</code> in the root of the parent Swift source tree. We also maintain a mailing group so you can <a href="mailto:code-owners@forums.swift.org">send an email</a> to all the code owners.</p>

<p>There may be nothing more important to the success of Swift than strong, engaged code owners. We all owe them respect, gratitude, and whatever help we can offer.</p>

<p>Each contributor is responsible for adding his or her name to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file at the project’s root and maintaining the contact information. If you are contributing under the umbrella of your company, please add your company’s information, and do not also list yourself as an additional copyright holder.</p>
